    <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
    <p>
      As you may have seen, I'm Robin (aka MrAnyx) and I'm a
      <b class="accent-text">tech and open-source enthusiast</b>. Since 2019,
      I'm specialized in <b class="accent-text">fullstack web development</b>. I
      am currently a french <b class="accent-text">software engineer</b> in a
      company called
      <b class="accent-text">Icohup</b>
      which creates connected radioactivity sensors. Besides that, I created my
      micro business called <b class="accent-text">Codeon</b> in which I create
      websites or web application for individuals or startups. One thing i
      really like is to build apps and things and share them on the Internet so
      that people can give their feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first experienced web development when I was in 9th grade. With a friend
      of mine, we tried to create our very first website using HTML and CSS
      thanks to the explanations and tutorials that we could find on "le site du
      z√©ro" (now known as
      <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/" target="_blank" class="accent"
        >OpenClassrooms</a
      >). I spent a lot of time trying to create a navigation bar or a paragraph
      and align it all in an HTML page. That was fun üòÑ
    </p>

    <p>
      I started programming and development with Python (very original üòÑ) but
      it was when I discovered web technologies that I really started to get
      involved in this environment. I started with the basics with HTML, CSS and
      Javascript, then I continued with CSS frameworks such as bootstrap. Quite
      quickly, I got interested in backend frameworks like Symfony or Laravel or
      even Javascript frameworks like React or Electron. I was fascinated by
      these technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      With all the knowledge that I have been able to accumulate over all these
      years, I started to create small projects like the game of life or the
      langton's ant, both available in the
      <nuxt-link to="projects" class="accent">projects page</nuxt-link>. Then,
      the more I developed, the more my ambitions increased and my projects
      grew. From thread to needle, I gathered enough knowledge to create my
      biggest project yet :
      <a href="https://needlify.com" class="accent" target="_blank">Needlify</a
      >, a platform where
      <b class="accent-text"
        >people can share and learn things around new technologies</b
      >. I spent almost a year creating this project. In reality, I had to start
      over from the beginning because the bases I had created did not correspond
      to what I wanted to achieve. Then I knew how to seize the opportunities
      that were given to me and optimize my time to concentrate on this project.
      In 5 months, the development projects were completed and the site was in
      production.
    </p>

    <p>
      For quite some time now, I've really enjoyed discovering new technologies
      like: Electron, Nuxt, Vue.js or even new programming languages like Pony
      or Vlang and trying to create projects with that. Believe me, I have no
      shortage of ideas. I have an endless list of project ideas, sometimes
      totally implausible, that I try to achieve as soon as I have the ability
      and the inclination.
    </p>

    <p>
      For everything related to programming or the tools I use, I advise you to
      take a look at the
      <nuxt-link to="projects" class="accent">projects</nuxt-link> or
      <nuxt-link to="tools" class="accent">tools</nuxt-link> page. If you have
      any questions regarding these areas, you can contact me via social
      networks or by <a href="mailto://robin@codeon.fr" class="accent">mail</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, to keep track of what I achieve during the year, I created a
      <a
        href="https://codeon.notion.site/Roadmap-2021-2022-92830dd78ad5471b8b79303c74b110f8"
        target="_blank"
        class="accent"
        >development roadmap</a
      >
      for myself. It therefore allows me to know what I want to learn or what I
      would like to improve myself on. You can take inspiration from it, if you
      feel like it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides programming, I try to write articles regularly in order to share
      my knowledge. I am also a music lover which means as soon as I do
      something <b class="accent-text">I MUST have music in my ears</b>.
      Finally, I try as much as possible to stay organized, which is why I love
      organizational and planning tools such as
      <a href="https://www.notion.so/" class="accent" target="_blank">Notion</a>
      or
      <a href="https://todoist.com" target="_blank" class="accent">Todoist</a>.
      This allows me to plan my weeks and days to be more productive.
