compared to other pioneers like C/C++ or Python.

In general terms, Pony is an object oriented programming language which means that you can create classes, interfaces, traits, ... But the main difference that Pony has, is that it also an Actor/Model oriented programming language. Actors are objects that look like classes except that their behaviours are asynchronous. In other words, if you call the behaviour foo before another behaviour called bar, in some cases, depending on the body of these behaviours, bar can return a result before foo.
