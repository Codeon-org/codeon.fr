Being our last participation, we wanted to finish in style. In this way, we have been rewarded 3 times. We first finished second in the challenge "Carbon code: sensitize users to the impact of their choices" proposed by the company Leroy Merlin in which we had to, via the use of a REST API created by us , show the CO2 consumption of the pages viewed by a user. We were also rewarded for the first time by the company Apside TOP by finishing second in the challenge "1337 5P34K" in which we had to transform the entire text of our site into Leet Speak. Finally, we were once again rewarded by this same company by finishing first in the "Oualle Strite Ingliche" challenge whose main objective was to create a website accessible by English and French speakers. Finally, Coddity praised our performance by awarding us fifth place out of a total of 35 for the "EMERGENCY MEETING !!!" challenge. in which we had to bring up references to the video game "Among us".',
