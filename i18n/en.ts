We were also rewarded for the first time by the company Apside TOP by finishing second in the challenge "1337 5P34K" in which we had to transform the entire text of our site into Leet Speak. Finally, we were once again rewarded by this same company by finishing first in the "Oualle Strite Ingliche" challenge whose main objective was to create a website accessible by English and French speakers. Finally, Coddity praised our performance by awarding us fifth place out of a total of 35 for the "EMERGENCY MEETING !!!" challenge. in which we had to refer to the video game "Among us".',
